## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Verify Before Buying

**Before purchasing ANY plan, you MUST:**

   - Ask: "Do I have SSH/terminal access for npm commands?"

2. **Why This Matters**:
   - Many shared hosting plans DON'T support Node.js
   - Next.js needs Node.js to run
   - Without Node.js, your website won't work
